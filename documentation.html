                                    The GRNmap code was developed and tested with MATLAB R2014b; it may not function properly with other versions of MATLAB.

                                    GRNmap is only compatible with the Windows operating system because of the function it uses to read and write Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. It has only been tested on Windows 7.

                <h3>production_rates sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    This sheet contains initial guesses for the production rate parameters,
                    <em>P</em>, for all genes in the network. Assuming that the system is in steady
                    state with the relative expression of all genes equal to 1, (P/2) -
                    lambda = 0, where lambda is the degradation rate, is a reasonable
                    initial guess. The sheet should contain two columns (from left to right)
                    entitled, "id", "production_rate". The id is an identifier that the
                    user will use to identify a particular gene. The "production_rate"
                    column should then contain the initial guesses for the P parameter as
                    described above, rounded to four decimal places. The genes should be
                    listed in the same order in all the sheets in the Excel workbook.
                </p>
                <h3>degredation_rates sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    This sheet contains degradation rates for all genes in the network,
                    which are provided by the user. Currently, the Dahlquist Lab is using
                    data based on published protein half-life data from
                    <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/35/13004">Belle et al. (2006)</a>.
                    We converted the half-life data values to the degradation rates by taking the
                    natural log of the half-life and dividing by 2. The sheet should contain two
                    columns (from left to right) entitled "id", and "degradation_rate". The id is
                    an identifier that the user will use to identify a particular gene. The
                    "degradation_rate" column should then contain the absolute value of the
                    degradation rate for the corresponding gene as described above, rounded to
                    four decimal places. The genes should be listed in the same order in all the
                    sheets in the Excel workbook.
                </p>
                <h3>Expression Data Sheets for Individual Yeast Strains</h3>
                <p>
                    Expression data can be provided for either a single strain or multiple strains of yeast
                    (for example, the wild type strain and a transcription factor deletion strain).
                    Each strain will have its own sheet in the workbook.
                    Each sheet should be given a unique name that follows the convention
                    "STRAIN_log2_expression", where the word "STRAIN" is replaced by the
                    strain designation, which will appear in the optimization_diagnostics sheet.
                    The sheet should have the following columns in this order:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            "id": list of all genes. The genes should be listed in the same order in all the sheets in the Excel workbook.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The next series of columns should contain the expression data for each gene
                            at a given timepoint given as log2 ratios (log2 fold changes).
                            The column header should be the time at which the data were collected, without any units.
                            For example, the 15 minute timepoint would have a column header "15" and the 30 minute
                            timepoint would have the column header "30". GRNmap supports replicate data for each of the
                            timepoints. Replicate data for the same timepoint should be in columns immediately next to
                            each other and have the same column headers. For example, three replicates of the 15 minute
                            timepoint would have "15", "15", "15" as the column headers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If data are provided for multiple strains, each strain should have data for the same timepoints.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the 21-genes_50-edges_Dahlquist-data_MM_estimation.xls and
                    21-genes_50-edges_Dahlquist-data_Sigmoid_estimation.xls input workbooks found in the test_files
                    > data_samples directory on GitHub has the following STRAIN_log2_expression sheets:

                </p>
                <h3>network sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    Adjacency matrix representation of the gene regulatory network.
                    The columns correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond
                    to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors. A “1” means
                    there is an edge connecting them and a “0” means that there is no edge connecting
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The upper-left cell (A1) should contain the text “cols regulators/rows targets”.
                            This text is there as a reminder of the direction of the regulatory relationships
                            specified by the adjacency matrix.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rest of row 1 should contain the names of the transcription factors that are controlling the other
                            genes in the network, one transcription factor name per column.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rest of column A should contain the names of the target genes that are being controlled by the
                            transcription factors heading each of the columns in the matrix, one target gene name per row.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The transcription factor names should correspond to the "id" in the other sheets in the workbook.
                            They should be capitalized the same way and occur in the same order along the top and side of the matrix.
                            The matrix needs to be symmetric, i.e., the same transcription factors should appear along the top and
                            left side of the matrix. The genes should be listed in the same order in all the sheets in the Excel workbook.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each cell in the matrix should then contain a zero (0) if there is no regulatory relationship between those
                            two transcription factors, or a one (1) if there is a regulatory relationship between them. Again, the columns
                            correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>network_weights sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    The same format as the “network” sheet above. These are the initial guesses for the
                    estimation of the weight parameters, w. Since these weights are initial guesses which
                    will be optimized by GRNmap, the content of this sheet can be identical to the network
                    sheet.
                </p>
                <h3>optimization_parameters sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    The optimization_parameters sheet should have two columns (from left to right) entitled,
                    "optimization_parameter" and "value". The "optimization_parameter" column should contain the following:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            alpha: Penalty term weighting (from the L-curve analysis)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            kk_max: Number of times to re-run the optimization loop. In some cases re-starting the optimization loop can improve performance of the estimation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MaxIter: Number of times MATLAB iterates through the optimization scheme. If this is set too low, MATLAB will stop before the parameters are optimized.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TolFun: How different two least squares evaluations should be before the program determines that it is not making any improvement
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MaxFunEval: maximum number of times the program will evaluate the least squares cost
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TolX: How close successive least squares cost evaluations should
                            be before the program determines that it is not making any improvement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            production_function: = Sigmoid (case-insensitive) if sigmoidal model,
                            =MM (case-insensitive) if Michaelis-Menten model
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            L_curve: =0 if an L-curve analysis should NOT be run or =1 if an L-curve analysis SHOULD be run.
                            The L-curve analysis will automatically run sequential rounds of estimation for an array of fixed
                            alpha values (0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1,0.08, 0.05,0.02,0.01, 0.008, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0008, 0.0005,
                            0.0002, and 0.0001). GRNmap makes a copy of the user's selected input workbook and changes alpha
                            to the first alpha in the list. The estimation runs and the resulting parameter values are used
                            as the initial guesses for the next round of estimation with the next alpha value. This process
                            repeats until all alpha values have been run. New input and output workbooks are generated for
                            each alpha value, although currently, the graphs are only saved for the last run.

                <p>
                    One worksheet is created for each strain specified in the optimization_parameters sheet in the input workbook.
                    The word "STRAIN" is replaced by the actual strain designation, e.g., wt_log2_optimized_expression.
                    This worksheet contains the "SystematicName" and the "StandardName" in the first two columns in
                    accordance to the "STRAIN_log2_expression" sheets from the input file. The rest of row 1 contains
                    the time points specified by the "simtime" parameter in the optimization_parameters worksheet in the input
                    workbook. The values in each cell for the remainder of the sheet correspond to the simulated log2 fold
                    change expression values for each gene for each timepoint. The program evaluates the differential equation
                    for each gene using the <em>w</em>, <em>P</em>, and <em>b</em> parameters. If the user has chosen to run a forward
                    simulation only, these parameters are taken from the network_weights, production_rates, and
                    threshold_b worksheets, respectively. If the user has chosen to estimate parameters, the <em>w</em>
                    parameter is taken from the network_optimized_weights sheet. If <em>P</em> has been estimated, its
                    value is taken from the optimized_production_rates sheet; if <em>b</em> has been estimated, its value
                    is taken from the optimized_threshold_b sheet.

                <h3>STRAIN_sigmas sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    One worksheet is created for each strain specified in the optimization_parameters sheet
                    in the input workbook. The word "STRAIN" is replaced by the actual strain designation,
                    e.g., wt_sigmas. This worksheet contains the "SystematicName" and the "StandardName"
                    in the first two columns in accordance to the "STRAIN_log2_expression" sheets from
                    the input file. There is then one column for each timepoint specified by the "time" parameter in the
                    optimization_diagnostics sheet in the input workbook. The values are the standard deviations of the
                    log2 fold changes of expression for each gene and timepoint computed from the data contained in the
                    corresponding STRAIN_log2_expression sheet.
                </p>
                <h3>optimized_production_rates sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    If fix_P = 0 in the optimization_parameters sheet in the input workbook, the production rates
                    are estimated and this sheet is created. This sheet contains the "SystematicName" and "StandardName"
                    just like in the production_rates sheet in the input workbook.
                    The "prorate" column contains the optimized production rates from the estimation procedure.
                </p>
                <h3>optimized_threshold_b sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    If fix_b = 0 from the optimization parameters sheet in the input workbook,
                    the threshold (<em>b</em>) parameters are estimated and this sheet is created.
                    This sheet contains the "SystematicName" and "StandardName" just like in the
                    worksheet described above. The third column, entitled "b", contains the optimized
                    threshold b parameters for each gene in the network.
                </p>
                <h3>network_optimized_weights sheet</h3>
                <p>
                    If estimateParams = 1 in the optimization_parameters sheet in the input workbook,
                    the weight parameters, w, are estimated and this sheet is created. The format of
                    this sheet is the same as the "network" sheet in the input workbook. However, the
                    "1's" of the adjacency matrix are replaced by the estimated w parameters. These
                    values represent the magnitude and sign of the regulatory relationship between
                    the transcription factors (genes located in the very first row) and the target
                    genes (genes in the leftmost column). Cell A1 contains the text "rows genes
                    affected/cols genes controlling" as a reminder of the direction of the regulatory
                    relationships specified by the adjacency matrix. If the value in the cell is negative,
                    the target gene is repressed. If the value is positive, the target gene is activated.
                    A value of 0 means that there is no regulatory relationship between those two transcription
                    factors.

                    This worksheet contains some diagnostic information about the estimation that can
                    be used to evaluate the performance of the model. The following information is presented.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top block</li>

                        <li>
                            LSE: the value of the overall least squares error for the estimation

                        <li>
                            Penalty: the value of the sum of squares of all parameters being estimated

                        <li>
                            min LSE: the value of the minimum least squares error possible for the estimation
                            that could be achieved given this particular set of expression data.
                            This value is obtained from the variance of the flask data for each time and for each gene

                            The left column, entitled "Gene", lists the IDs of the genes in the regulatory network,
                            in the order they appear in the other worksheets.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each column to the right is entitled "STRAIN SSE", where the word STRAIN is replaced by
                            the strain designation from the optimization_parameters sheet in the input workbook, for
                            example "wt MSE". The MSE value is the mean squared error comparing the simulated expression
                            data found in that particular strain's STRAIN_log2_optimized_expression sheet to the experimental
                            data found in the corresponding STRAIN_log2_expression sheet. The MSE gives an indication of how
                            well the model fits each individual gene's expression data, whereas the LSE value in the top block
                            indicates the overall performance of the model across all the genes.

                This sheet contains initial guesses for the production rate parameters, P, for all genes in the network. Assuming that the system is in steady state with the relative expression of all genes equal to 1, (P/2) - lambda = 0, where lambda is the degradation rate, is a reasonable initial guess. The sheet should contain three columns (from left to right) entitled, "SystematicName", "StandardName", and "production_rates". The SytematicName refers to the gene ID from the <a href='http://www.yeastgenome.org/'>Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)</a>, for example, YLR131C. The StandardName refers to the corresponding Standard Name for that gene from SGD, for example, ACE2. The "production_rates" column should then contain the initial guesses for the P parameter as described above.

                <p>Expression data can be provided for multiple strains of yeast (for example, the wild type strain and a transcription factor deletion strain). Each strain will have its own sheet in the workbook. Each sheet should be given a unique name corresponding to the name of the strain and have the following columns in order:

                        The next series of columns should contain the log2 expression data for each gene at a given timepoint. the column header should be the time at which the data were collected, without any units. For example, the 15 minute timepoint would have a column header "15" and the 30 minute timepoint would have the column header "30". GRNmap supports replicate data for each of the timepoints. Replicate data for the same timepoint should be in columns immediately next to each other and have the same column headers. For example, three replicates of the 15 minute timepoint would have "15", "15", "15" as the column headers.

                    Adjacency matrix representation of the gene regulatory network. The columns correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors. A “1” means there is an edge connecting them and a “0” means that there is no edge connecting them.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The upper-left cell (A1) should contain the text “rows genes affected/cols genes controlling”. This text is there as a reminder of the direction of the regulatory relationships specified by the adjacency matrix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rest of the first row should contain the names of the transcription factors that are controlling the other genes in the network, one transcription factor name per column.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rest of the first column should contain the names of the target genes that are being controlled by the transcription factors heading each of the columns in the matrix, one target gene name per row.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The transcription factor names should correspond to the "StandardNames" in the other sheets in the workbook. They should be capitalized the same way and occur in the same order along the top and side of the matrix. The matrix needs to be symmetric, i.e., the same transcription factors should appear along the top and side of the matrix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each cell in the matrix should then contain a zero (0) if there is no regulatory relationship between those two transcription factors, or a one (1) if there is a regulatory relationship between them. Again, the columns correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        kk_max: Number of times to re-run the optimization loop: in some cases re-starting the optimization loop can improve performance of the estimation. (Residual from when Stephanie was working on the code).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MaxIter: Number of times MATLAB iterates through the optimization scheme. If this is set too low, MATLAB will stop before the parameters are optimized.
                    </li>
                        TolFun: How different two least squares evaluations should be before it says it's not making any improvement
                    <li>
                        MaxFunEval: maximum number of times it will evaluate the least squares cost
                    </li>
                        TolX: How close successive least squares cost evaluations should be before MATLAB determines that it is not making any improvement.
                    <li>
                        Sigmoid: =1 if sigmoidal model, =0 if Michaelis-Menten model
                    </li>
                        estimateParams =1 if want to estimate parameters and =0 if the user wants to do just one forward run
                    <li>
                        makeGraphs =1 to output graphs; =0 to not output graphs

                    </li>
                        simtime: A row containing a list of the time points when the data was collected experimentally. Should correspond to the timepoint column headers in the expression sheets.
                    <li>
                        Strain: A row containing a list of all of the strains for which there is expression data in the workbook. Should correspond to the names of the sheets for each strain.
                    </li>
                        Sheet: A row where each entry is the order number of the sheet (left to right) that corresponds to the list of strains above.
                    <li>
                        Deletion: Gives the index of the gene in the network sheet that has been deleted in each strain listed above. For example, if data has been provided for the CIN5 deletion strain, then give the index number from the network sheet corresponding to CIN5.
