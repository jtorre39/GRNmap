                                    The GRNmap code was developed and tested with MATLAB R2014b; it may not function properly with other versions of MATLAB.

                                    GRNmap is only compatible with the Windows operating system because of the function it uses to read and write Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. It has only been tested on Windows 7.

                <h2>production_rates sheet</h2>
                <p>
                    This sheet contains initial guesses for the production rate parameters,
                    <em>P</em>, for all genes in the network. Assuming that the system is in steady
                    state with the relative expression of all genes equal to 1, (P/2) -
                    lambda = 0, where lambda is the degradation rate, is a reasonable
                    initial guess. The sheet should contain two columns (from left to right)
                    entitled, "id", "production_rate". The id is an identifier that the
                    user will use to identify a particular gene. The "production_rate"
                    column should then contain the initial guesses for the P parameter as
                    described above, rounded to four decimal places. The genes should be
                    listed in the same order in all the sheets in the Excel workbook.
                </p>
                <h2>degredation_rates sheet</h2>
                <p>
                    This sheet contains degradation rates for all genes in the network,
                    which are provided by the user. Currently, the Dahlquist Lab is using
                    data based on published protein half-life data from
                    <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/35/13004">Belle et al. (2006)</a>.
                    We converted the half-life data values to the degradation rates by taking the
                    natural log of the half-life and dividing by 2. The sheet should contain two
                    columns (from left to right) entitled "id", and "degradation_rate". The id is
                    an identifier that the user will use to identify a particular gene. The
                    "degradation_rate" column should then contain the absolute value of the
                    degradation rate for the corresponding gene as described above, rounded to
                    four decimal places. The genes should be listed in the same order in all the
                    sheets in the Excel workbook.
                </p>
                <h2>Expression Data Sheets for Individual Yeast Strains</h2>
                <p>
                    Expression data can be provided for either a single strain or multiple strains of yeast
                    (for example, the wild type strain and a transcription factor deletion strain).
                    Each strain will have its own sheet in the workbook.
                    Each sheet should be given a unique name that follows the convention
                    "STRAIN_log2_expression", where the word "STRAIN" is replaced by the
                    strain designation, which will appear in the optimization_diagnostics sheet.
                    The sheet should have the following columns in this order:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            "id": list of all genes. The genes should be listed in the same order in all the sheets in the Excel workbook.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The next series of columns should contain the expression data for each gene
                            at a given timepoint given as log2 ratios (log2 fold changes).
                            The column header should be the time at which the data were collected, without any units.
                            For example, the 15 minute timepoint would have a column header "15" and the 30 minute
                            timepoint would have the column header "30". GRNmap supports replicate data for each of the
                            timepoints. Replicate data for the same timepoint should be in columns immediately next to
                            each other and have the same column headers. For example, three replicates of the 15 minute
                            timepoint would have "15", "15", "15" as the column headers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If data are provided for multiple strains, each strain should have data for the same timepoints.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the 21-genes_50-edges_Dahlquist-data_MM_estimation.xls and
                    21-genes_50-edges_Dahlquist-data_Sigmoid_estimation.xls input workbooks found in the test_files
                    > data_samples directory on GitHub has the following STRAIN_log2_expression sheets:

                <h2>network sheet</h2>
                <p>
                    Adjacency matrix representation of the gene regulatory network.
                    The columns correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond
                    to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors. A “1” means
                    there is an edge connecting them and a “0” means that there is no edge connecting
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The upper-left cell (A1) should contain the text “cols regulators/rows targets”.
                            This text is there as a reminder of the direction of the regulatory relationships
                            specified by the adjacency matrix.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rest of row 1 should contain the names of the transcription factors that are controlling the other
                            genes in the network, one transcription factor name per column.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rest of column A should contain the names of the target genes that are being controlled by the
                            transcription factors heading each of the columns in the matrix, one target gene name per row.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The transcription factor names should correspond to the "id" in the other sheets in the workbook.
                            They should be capitalized the same way and occur in the same order along the top and side of the matrix.
                            The matrix needs to be symmetric, i.e., the same transcription factors should appear along the top and
                            left side of the matrix. The genes should be listed in the same order in all the sheets in the Excel workbook.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each cell in the matrix should then contain a zero (0) if there is no regulatory relationship between those
                            two transcription factors, or a one (1) if there is a regulatory relationship between them. Again, the columns
                            correspond to the transcription factors and the rows correspond to the target genes controlled by those transcription factors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>network_weights sheet</h2>
                <p>
                    The same format as the “network” sheet above. These are the initial guesses for the
                    estimation of the weight parameters, w. Since these weights are initial guesses which
                    will be optimized by GRNmap, the content of this sheet can be identical to the network
                    sheet.
                </p>
                <h2>optimization_parameters sheet</h2>
                <p>
                    The optimization_parameters sheet should have two columns (from left to right) entitled,
                    "optimization_parameter" and "value". The "optimization_parameter" column should contain the following:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            alpha: Penalty term weighting (from the L-curve analysis)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            kk_max: Number of times to re-run the optimization loop. In some cases re-starting the optimization loop can improve performance of the estimation.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MaxIter: Number of times MATLAB iterates through the optimization scheme. If this is set too low, MATLAB will stop before the parameters are optimized.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TolFun: How different two least squares evaluations should be before the program determines that it is not making any improvement
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MaxFunEval: maximum number of times the program will evaluate the least squares cost
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TolX: How close successive least squares cost evaluations should
                            be before the program determines that it is not making any improvement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            production_function: = Sigmoid (case-insensitive) if sigmoidal model,
                            =MM (case-insensitive) if Michaelis-Menten model
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            L_curve: =0 if an L-curve analysis should NOT be run or =1 if an L-curve analysis SHOULD be run.
                            The L-curve analysis will automatically run sequential rounds of estimation for an array of fixed
                            alpha values (0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1,0.08, 0.05,0.02,0.01, 0.008, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0008, 0.0005,
                            0.0002, and 0.0001). GRNmap makes a copy of the user's selected input workbook and changes alpha
                            to the first alpha in the list. The estimation runs and the resulting parameter values are used
                            as the initial guesses for the next round of estimation with the next alpha value. This process
                            repeats until all alpha values have been run. New input and output workbooks are generated for
                            each alpha value, although currently, the graphs are only saved for the last run.

                This sheet contains initial guesses for the production rate parameters, P, for all genes in the network. Assuming that the system is in steady state with the relative expression of all genes equal to 1, (P/2) - lambda = 0, where lambda is the degradation rate, is a reasonable initial guess. The sheet should contain three columns (from left to right) entitled, "SystematicName", "StandardName", and "production_rates". The SytematicName refers to the gene ID from the <a href='http://www.yeastgenome.org/'>Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)</a>, for example, YLR131C. The StandardName refers to the corresponding Standard Name for that gene from SGD, for example, ACE2. The "production_rates" column should then contain the initial guesses for the P parameter as described above.

                <p>Expression data can be provided for multiple strains of yeast (for example, the wild type strain and a transcription factor deletion strain). Each strain will have its own sheet in the workbook. Each sheet should be given a unique name corresponding to the name of the strain and have the following columns in order:

                <ol>
                    <li>

                        The next series of columns should contain the log2 expression data for each gene at a given timepoint. the column header should be the time at which the data were collected, without any units. For example, the 15 minute timepoint would have a column header "15" and the 30 minute timepoint would have the column header "30". GRNmap supports replicate data for each of the timepoints. Replicate data for the same timepoint should be in columns immediately next to each other and have the same column headers. For example, three replicates of the 15 minute timepoint would have "15", "15", "15" as the column headers.
